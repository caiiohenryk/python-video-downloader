# 🐍 **Python Video Downloader**

## 🎯 **Goal**

Download videos from X (or Twitter, for the older ones hahaha) running a simple python file.
This repository is very useful to me, but i hope you all enjoy and can use it!

## **How to install**

First, you have to clone this repository to an empty folder.
After that, you can run the following line on your terminal to install the first and unique dependence on this project:
```
pip install yt-dlp
```

Finally, you can run the *video-downloader.py* file.

It will ask you the X/Twitter video link. After you provide that, the video download will start in the best possible resolution!!
